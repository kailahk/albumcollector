# Album Collector

Album Collector is a Full-stack, full CRUD web application that I designed to give users a private digital space to organize their favorite albums. The app allows visitors to create an account or sign up if they already have one, create named and color-coded lists, upload album information to associate with their lists, upload official album artwork and/or their own custom artwork, and track their album listens. Many music lovers associate different albums together for a variety of reasons, and this gives them a space to dynamically create and edit lists of albums without crowding the streaming platform where they keep their saved music and playlists. Whether you want to keep track of your physical vinyl inventory, create a list of your favorite albums from a certain release year, keep a list of albums you'd like to listen to in the future, or something else, Album Collector is a useful website for any music lover.
